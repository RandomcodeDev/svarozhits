# Сварожиц RISC-V game console

I got bored, so now I'm gonna try making a game console. This isn't a serious project and I'll probably get bored of it soon.

Svarozhits is a Slavic fire god or something (I looked at a list and it was the coolest name).

I'm planning to use a RISC-V CPU and wire it up to an Xbox 360 Xenos GPU (they're really cheap on Alibaba and I found a boardview
for them).

I'm writing a kernel and stuff in Rust, cause why not.
